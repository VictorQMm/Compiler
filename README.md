# Compiler
This repository showcases the development of a simplified Pascal compiler, created as part of the academic activities of the Computer Science program at UNESPAR, Apucarana campus. The project aims to apply core compiler concepts such as lexical, syntactic, and semantic analysis, as well as intermediate code generation.
